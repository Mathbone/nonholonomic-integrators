# nonholonomic-integrators
This repository is the beginnings of my dissertation code. The dissertation will focus on using non-holonomic integrators to answer the following question: "A unicyclist will lean into the turn when taking turns at high speed. Does this maneuver decrease the time to make the turn or is it for the purposes of increasing stability?"
